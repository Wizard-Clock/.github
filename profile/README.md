## Welcome to the Wizarding Clock Project
- Developed by Andrew Feely of House Ravenclaw.
## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a real world version of the Weasley's Clock from the Harry Potter franchise.
## Overview
This clock tells the location of each family member instead of the time. There is a hand for each family member, and there are 13 positions on the clock instead of 12. The project consists of three parts; the location server, the tracking app, and the physical clock.
